# The Cryptopedia World

## Introduction
*The Cryptopedia is a community encyclopedia about cryptocurrencies, crypto economy, and blockchain technology. When we first get started with cryptocurrencies, terms and concepts may sound foreign. It can take significant time to understand how to implement the information and dive into the fantastic possibilities available in digital investments and decentralized finances. The goal of The Cryptopedia is to help people get basic crypto information faster and in a friendly manner. The Cryptopedia is free to use, and all are welcome to join in contributing and building the archives.*

The Cryptopedia is a Python-Flask-based web application that lists crypto informational content in the form of an online interactive encyclopedia, backed by a MongoDB collection. The Cryptopedia ia a cloud app deployed via the Heroku PaaS, and consists of a lightweight, responsive and website built using Google's Materialize as CSS Framework. As you read this document, you will find my complete development process, from UX strategy to deployment.
